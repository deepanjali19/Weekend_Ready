This is my first android mobile application. I worked on this project with my college mate Pavan Kumar Kamra.

This app named **Weekend Ready** asks the user for the permission to access their location.

Once user location is accessed, the app shows three options namely: *Park, Restaurant and Library*.

When the user clicks any of the three option, locations close to user of the respective options displays on the map.

For example, if the user clicks *Park*, then nearby parks are shown to him/her. User can click on any of the park to see the name and address of the place. The same functionality works for nearby *restaurants* and *libraries* as well.

User location is shown using a blue dot and other nearby locations are shown using green dots.

The folder named 'screenshots' shows how the app looks.
